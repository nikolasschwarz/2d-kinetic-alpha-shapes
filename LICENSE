This software uses Eigen as a Git submodule linking to the official Eigen repository.
Eigen is licensed under MPL 2.0 - see eigen/COPYING.MPL2 or https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/

This software is designed to work with CGAL (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library),
which is typically required for full functionality. CGAL is an external dependency
(not included in this repository) and is available under:
- LGPL v3 (open source) - see https://www.cgal.org/license.html
- Commercial license - see https://www.cgal.org/license.html

IMPORTANT: When using this library with CGAL features enabled, users must comply
with CGAL's license terms. If using CGAL under LGPL v3, the combined work must
comply with LGPL v3 requirements. If using CGAL under a commercial license,
users must have a valid CGAL commercial license.

This library itself is licensed under MIT and may be used commercially without
restriction. However, when combined with CGAL (which is commonly required), the
applicable license terms depend on how CGAL is licensed in your project.
